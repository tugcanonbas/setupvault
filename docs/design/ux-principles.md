# UX Principles

## Calm Technology
- Stay in the periphery: detection is passive, notifications are subtle.
- No nagging: snooze is a first-class action.
- Silent success: command-line outputs nothing on success.
- Graceful failure: errors are logged without interrupting workflows.
- Confirm destructive or high-impact actions before applying.

## Intent-First
- Every entry requires a rationale.
- The rationale is presented as the primary field in capture flows.
- The command is automated and secondary.

## Accessibility and Discoverability
- Standard keys work as expected: arrows, enter, escape, tab.
- Power-user bindings are available but never required.
- Help overlay is context-aware and always reachable.
- Manual capture is available from any tab.

## Speed and Flow
- Optimistic UI updates for accept/snooze/ignore.
- Batch processing in the inbox.
- Minimal typing for common paths.

## Trust and Transparency
- All data lives locally and is human-readable.
- Users can inspect entries in raw Markdown.
- Vault survives without the app.
